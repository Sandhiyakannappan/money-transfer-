# money-transfer-A money transfer is a process of sending money from one person or entity to another, typically through a financial institution or a money transfer service. It is a way to send money to someone who is not in the same physical location as you, whether it's in the same country or a different one.

Money transfers can be made in various ways, such as through wire transfers, electronic funds transfers (EFTs), mobile money transfers, or online money transfer services like PayPal, Western Union, or MoneyGram. The sender typically initiates the transfer by providing the recipient's name, the amount to be sent, and the destination of the transfer. The recipient then receives the money at the designated location, such as a bank account or a cash pickup location.
